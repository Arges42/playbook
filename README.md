# playbook

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

[python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installing
Create a new directory where the playbook will be saved. E.g.:

    mkdir ~/playbook
    
Download the repository either as a zip or use git:

    cd ~/playbook
    git clone https://github.com/Arges42/playbook.git
  
Mac and Linux: 
  
    run ./install to create a globally callable script
    
Windows:

Right now, there is no install script.
Use the WindowsPowerShell and compile it manually:

        cd ~/playbook
        python setup.py build

Then manually create a shortcut to main.exe located at playbook/build/exe.\*/main.exe
    
## Useage
Type 'playbook' into the terminal
